# Cursor Rule: YouTube Blog Articles (Human, Specific, SEO-Strong)

## Purpose
When generating blog articles for this site, write **high-signal, human-sounding** educational content about YouTube growth (subscribers, views, retention, ideas, titles/thumbnails, analytics, strategy). The goal is: a real creator reads it and immediately knows what to do next.

These articles must:
- Teach concrete, actionable ideas (not generic motivation)
- Be easy to scan and understand (good UX/UI writing)
- Be SEO-friendly without keyword stuffing
- Avoid “obvious AI” framing, filler, and jargon

---

## Hard Bans (Do Not Output)
Never create headings/sections or phrases like:
- “Levers”, “XYZ levers”, “framework”, “pillars”, “flywheel”
- “Packaging”, “Engine”, “Checklist”
- “Unlock”, “secret hack”, “game-changer”, “ultimate guide” (unless truly justified)
- “In today’s digital landscape…”
- “As an AI…”
- Long preambles about why YouTube is important
- Vague claims without a mechanism (“do X to grow faster” with no explanation why)

If a draft contains any banned items, rewrite those sections into **plain-English, specific** headings and paragraphs.

---

## Voice & Tone
- Sound like a **practicing YouTube strategist** explaining what actually works.
- Use short sentences where possible.
- Be direct. Prefer “Do this because…” over “Consider…”.
- Avoid hype. Prefer measurable outcomes and tradeoffs.
- Write for creators who want results and hate fluff.

---

## Article Structure Requirements (Use This Shape)
Every article must include these parts in this order:

### 1) Title (Clear benefit + specific topic)
- Not clickbait.
- Example pattern: “How to Increase YouTube Subscriber Rate (With Examples You Can Copy)”

### 2) Opening (2–5 short paragraphs)
Must include:
- The problem stated plainly
- Who the advice is for (new channel vs established)
- What the reader will be able to do by the end
No long stories. No rambling.

### 3) Quick Definitions (Only if needed)
If the topic uses technical terms (CTR, AVD, retention, session time), define them in 1–2 lines each. If not needed, skip.

### 4) The Core Teaching (Mechanisms + Actions)
- Use **specific subheadings** that describe real actions, not abstract categories.
- Each section must include:
  - What to do
  - Why it works (the mechanism)
  - A concrete example (title, hook script, thumbnail concept, analytics interpretation, etc.)
  - Common mistake + how to avoid it

### 5) “Do This Next” (Short action plan)
Give a short, practical plan the reader can execute today:
- 3–7 steps
- Steps should be specific (e.g., “Open Analytics → Reach → sort videos by CTR and compare thumb/title pairs”)

### 6) FAQ (Optional but preferred for SEO)
- Only include questions people actually search
- Each answer: 2–6 sentences, no fluff
- Don’t repeat the article—add clarity or edge cases

### 7) Conclusion (Short)
- Summarize the key idea in 3–6 bullets
- End with a single simple next action (not a generic CTA)

---

## UX / Readability Rules
- Prefer scannable formatting:
  - Short paragraphs (1–4 lines)
  - Bullets for lists
  - Tables only when they clarify choices (and keep them small)
- Headings must be descriptive and non-generic.
  - Bad: “Optimize your strategy”
  - Good: “Rewrite your first 15 seconds to answer one question fast”
- Add micro-examples often:
  - Hook lines
  - Title variations
  - Thumbnail text options
  - Analytics “if you see X, do Y”

---

## SEO Rules (Without Being Spammy)
- Choose one primary keyword and 3–8 close variants.
- Use the primary keyword in:
  - Title
  - H1
  - First ~100 words (naturally)
  - 1–2 subheadings if it fits
- Add internal link placeholders like:
  - `[Internal link: Subscriber rate calculator]`
  - `[Internal link: How to write better hooks]`
- Use FAQ with question-style headings (people also ask).
- Never keyword-stuff.

---

## Evidence & Specificity Requirements
- Every claim must explain a causal mechanism.
  - Bad: “Shorter intros improve retention.”
  - Good: “Shorter intros reduce early drop-off because viewers decide in the first 10–20 seconds whether the video matches the title/thumbnail promise.”
- Whenever giving advice, include at least one:
  - Example script line
  - Example title
  - Example thumbnail concept
  - Example analytics interpretation
- If mentioning metrics, include typical ranges and what they mean (with caveats).

---

## YouTube-Specific Guidance (Use When Relevant)
We prioritize tactics that affect:
- Click decision (title/thumbnail)
- First 30 seconds retention (promise + pacing)
- Satisfaction signals (watching another video, comments with intent, saves/shares)
- Subscriber conversion (end screens, series, expectation-setting)

Include tactical guidance on:
- End screen strategy (specific next video selection)
- Series positioning (“If you liked X, watch Y next”)
- Upload consistency as quality consistency (not “post every day”)

Avoid outdated myths unless debunking them with reasoning.

---

## Quality Gate (Must Pass Before Final Output)
Before finishing, verify:
- No banned headings/phrases appear
- No section reads like generic “creator motivation”
- Each major section has an example + mistake + fix
- The reader can implement the advice in under 60 minutes
- Headings are concrete and descriptive
- The article teaches something non-obvious or at least unusually clear

If any check fails, revise until it passes.

---

## Output Format
- Output clean Markdown.
- Use one H1.
- Use H2/H3 for structure.
- No front-matter unless explicitly requested.
