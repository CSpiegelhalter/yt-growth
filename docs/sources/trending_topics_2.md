# Finding Trending YouTube Video Topics (Notes)

## Overview
This guide outlines multiple ways to find YouTube video topics that are currently trending, using both YouTube-native features and external trend/keyword tools. The goal is to generate topic ideas you can model, adapt, and publish quickly—especially for new channels that need momentum.

---

## Method 1: YouTube Trending Feed
**What it is:** YouTube’s built-in “Trending” section.

**How to use it:**
- Go to YouTube home page.
- In the left sidebar, open **Trending**.
- Review categories like:
  - **Now**
  - **Music**
  - **Gaming**
  - **Movies**
- Scroll through trending videos and **identify repeatable formats**:
  - Reaction-style videos to trending clips
  - Commentary on trending topics
  - “Explainer” versions of what’s trending

**Best for:**
- Fast inspiration
- Content formats that can be remixed (reaction/commentary)

**Notes:**
- Check what’s trending in **YouTube Shorts** too.
- Try to “recreate the pattern,” not copy the exact video.

## Method 2: Oneof10 (Video Outliers)
**Tool:** oneof10.com

**Core idea:** Find “outlier” videos—videos that dramatically outperform a channel’s normal view count. These can indicate trending topics, angles, or hooks.

### Option A: Free Chrome Extension
- Install the Oneof10 Chrome extension
- Visit competitor channels manually
- Identify their outlier videos

### Option B: Paid Dashboard + Filters
**Recommended for scaling and speed.**

**Key filters to use:**
- **Multiplier:** how many times higher views are vs usual (example: 10x)
- **Minimum views:** example: 5,000+
- **Publication date:** last **30 days** (or last 3–6 months for broader patterns)
- **Subscriber count:** optional constraint depending on your strategy

**Workflow:**
1. Set filters (especially **Publication date = last month**).
2. Click “Surprise me” to get outlier videos.
3. Optionally enter a **keyword** related to your niche (e.g., “business,” “AI,” “marketing”).
4. Convert the idea into your own version:
   - Example transformation:
     - “The real reason no one wants to work anymore”
     - → “The real reason no one wants to make videos anymore”
     - → “Why everyone is quitting YouTube (and what to do instead)”

**Output practice:**
- Save topic candidates into a spreadsheet or project tool.
- Repeat regularly.

## Method 3: YouTube Analytics → Research Tab
**What it is:** A YouTube Studio feature that shows what your audience is searching for and content trends in your category.

**How to use it:**
- Open **YouTube Studio**
- Go to **Analytics**
- Open the **Research** tab

**What to look for:**
- **Top searches** related to your channel/category
- Topics your audience is actively searching for
- Example ideas surfaced by research:
  - “Earn $100 every 30 minutes with Google”
  - “How to earn $145 an hour with ChatGPT”
  - “How to build a website fast”

**How to apply:**
- Look for topics that have evidence of recent performance.
- Create a version aligned to your channel (don’t blindly copy topics outside your expertise).
- Use this to find trends that are already “approved” by your audience + algorithm placement.

**Why it works:**
- YouTube wants creators to make content viewers are searching for.

## Method 4: Trend Spotting Platforms (Glimpse + Exploding Topics)
**Goal:** Find trends early (before they go mainstream) and publish content ahead of the crowd.

### Glimpse
**How to use (free path):**

- Declining birth rates / cost to raise children (trend context topic)

**Pro tip:**
- Paid plan expands to thousands of trends, but the free version can still spark strong video topics.

### Exploding Topics
**How to use:**
- Filter by a date range (free version may show up to ~2 years)
- Filter by category/niche (example used: ecommerce)
- Browse topics and turn them into video angles

**Example topics mentioned:**

**Use case:**

## Method 5: TikTok for Trending Topics
**Purpose:** Use TikTok as a trend-detection engine, then adapt winners to YouTube.

**Important note:** The workflow described depends on mobile filtering.

**How to use (mobile):**
1. Open TikTok
2. Search your niche keyword (example: “marketing”)
3. Tap the filter icon / menu (three dots or filter control)
4. Set:
   - **Posted within:** last 3 months (adjust as needed)
   - **Sort by:** like count
5. Review high-like videos for topic patterns and hooks

**Tips:**
- Expect some low-quality or “cringy” content—use it for ideation only.
- Focus on repeatable concepts and hooks, not exact copying.

3. Use outlier detection for proven performance:
   - Oneof10
4. Use “audience-aligned” insights:
   - YouTube Research tab
5. Save topics consistently:
