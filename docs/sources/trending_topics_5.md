## Step-by-Step Content Creation Workflow

### Step 1 — Pick a Niche (YouTube Research)
- Open **Chrome incognito**
- Go to **YouTube Shorts**
- Scroll to find:
  - High-like Shorts
  - Channels with strong view velocity (e.g., millions of views per video)
- Target format:
  - “Commentary AI videos”

### Step 2 — Find Source Clips (TikTok)
- Go to **TikTok**
- Click **Explore**
- Important instruction: **Do not log in**
- Find a “cool” clip (example used: pets saving owners)

### Step 3 — Download Source Clip (External Downloader)
- Uses a site/tool described as: “**download TikTok video HD**”
- Steps:
  - Paste TikTok link
  - Select **HD**
  - Save locally

> Note: This is a common “repurposing” workflow: TikTok → downloaded clip → edited Short.

---

## Scriptwriting Workflow (Manual, Not AI)
### Tool
- **Google Docs**

### Process
- Put the video beside the doc
- Write a script by describing what happens on-screen:
  - Clip 1 example summary:
    - “Lady entering house, bear appears, dog defends, bear runs away”
  - Clip 2 example summary:
    - “Owner opens door, big cat attacks, dog intervenes”

### Guidance / Constraints
- **Do not use AI to write the script**
  - Explicitly says not to use Gemini or other AIs
  - Reason given: AI makes scripts “really bad”
- Keeps Shorts short:
  - “Usually good around **20 seconds**”
  - Says you can go longer, but demonstrates ~20 seconds

---

## Voiceover Generation (11Labs)
### Tool
- **ElevenLabs** (text-to-speech)

### Steps
- Go to **Text to Speech**
- Paste script
- Generate audio
- Download voiceover file

### Voice / Settings
- Favorite voice: “**max deep and crisp**”
- Settings mentioned (as spoken):
  - “30%, 30%, 80%, and then 1.14”
  - (Unclear which parameters these correspond to; likely stability/similarity/style + speed)

---

## Editing Workflow (CapCut)
### Tool
- **CapCut** (referred to as “CapKa”; described as free)

### Assembly Steps
1. Import:
   - Video clip(s)
   - Voiceover audio
2. Trim video length to match narration
3. Split voiceover segments so they “overlap” slightly (avoid dead air)
4. Lower original video audio volume:
   - Example volume: “**8.7**”
5. Cut video if it runs longer than voiceover
6. Add next clip(s) after the first segment ends

---

## Captions & Styling
### Auto Captions
- Before generating captions:
  - Make the timeline a **compound clip** (so “it’s all together”)
- Generate **auto captions**
- Position captions:
  - “Put it in the middle”

### Caption Animation & Font
- Animation: **Color Bounce** (favorite)
- Font: “**TD4’s child**”
- Add **stroke**:
  - “around **50%**”

---

## Virality Enhancers (Effects / Motion / Sound)
The speaker says basic assembly works, but to improve viral potential add:
- Zooms
- Sound effects
- Risers
- Shapes (circles/arrows)
- Tracking motion

### Zoom & Keyframe Method
- Split clips at sentence boundaries
- Add zoom animation:
  - Example: set to **3 seconds**
- Use transform **keyframes**:
  - Keyframe at start
  - Keyframe at end
  - Zoom + reposition over time
- Tracking strategy:
  - Zoom onto key subject (e.g., bear)
  - Adjust position frame-by-frame to “track it”

### Shapes / Callouts (Circle)
- Adds a **red circle** overlay
- Makes it thinner using a **mask**
- Tracks subject by adjusting transform over time
- Adds exit animation:
  - Fade out

### Sound Effects Pack (Upsell)
- Mentions an assets pack “in the description” including:
  - Circles
  - Sound effects
  - Songs
  - Risers
- Sound examples:
  - “**ding**” (spelled “Dean” in the transcript)
  - “awkward moment” sound
- Sound mixing:
  - Doesn’t want it too loud (example: set to “**7**”)

---

## Export & Title Strategy
### Export
- Export video from CapCut
- Example filename/title:
  - “times when animals or pets saved their owners”

### Emoji Myth
- Claims adding an emoji **does not** lower RPM or views
- Main advice:
  - Keep title strongly related to the content

---

## Posting Workflow (Avoiding “Zero View Jail”)
### Account Aging / Warming
- Says you should “age” the channel/account
- Example:
  - Created account in **2023**
  - Started posting “a little over a month ago”
  - Claims that helped reach millions of views

### Warm-Up Behaviors (Especially for New or Dormant Accounts)
Do these for a few days:
- Watch videos in your niche
- Like and comment
- Scroll Shorts
- Act like a normal user
Rationale:
- YouTube may flag new or unused accounts as suspicious

### Uploading Method
- Claims uploading **from phone** helps escape “zero view jail”
- Workflow:
  - Send video from computer → phone
  - Watch Shorts for ~**1 hour** (especially new accounts)
  - Upload through the YouTube mobile app

### Posting Checklist
- Include: **#shorts**
- Mark: “**Not made for kids**”
- Set visibility: **Public** (says people forget this)

### Extra “Aging” Tactic
- Upload random phone-recorded clips (neighborhood videos) to warm the account
- If/when ready to focus the channel:
  - Delete the random videos
  - Start uploading niche content

---

## Motivation, Consistency, and “30,000 View Jail”
### Early Channel Reality (Speaker’s Claims)
- Many creators struggle with low views at first
- Expect the first **2–3 weeks** to be slow
- “30,000 view jail” described as Shorts repeatedly capping around that number

### Breakout Pattern
- Claims he broke out around **3 weeks**
- Strategy:
  - When a format performs well, repeat it
  - Keep the same type of content + format over and over

---

- Says monetization requires:
  - **10 million engaged views**
- Claims typical timeline for new creators:
