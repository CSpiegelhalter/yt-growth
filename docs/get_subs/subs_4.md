# YouTube: Get 1,000+ Subscribers by Using New Features + Better Metrics

## Purpose + Promise
- The speaker claims they’ve helped multiple creators gain 1,000+ subscribers.
- Core thesis: most creators aren’t using YouTube’s newest features and are relying on outdated approaches.
- Outcome promise: apply these “changes” to reach 1,000 subscribers and get monetized.

## Change 1: Make Sure Your Channel Is Set Up Correctly

### 1A) Studio Settings: Channel Keywords + Country
**Path:** YouTube Studio → Settings → Channel  
Checklist:
- Set the **correct country of residence**.
- Add **channel keywords** that align with your content.

Suggested keyword categories:
1. **Competitor names** (a few)
2. **Primary topics/keywords** you want to show up for
3. **Your channel tag / branded keyword**

Example given (speaker’s niche): ChatGPT, AI, automating work with AI, etc.

### 1B) Advanced Settings: Turn On “Hype”
**Path:** YouTube Studio → Settings → Channel → Advanced settings  
- Scroll down and make sure **“Hype” is turned on**.
- Claim: this is an “easy” lever to get views, and some people miss it because it’s new.

### 1C) Feature Eligibility: Everything Enabled
**Path:** YouTube Studio → Settings → Feature eligibility  
- Ensure **all three items are green and say “Enabled.”**

### 1D) Verify Your Phone Number
**Path:** youtube.com/verify  
- Confirm your phone number is verified.

> Rule stated: If any items in 1A–1D aren’t done, don’t move on.

## Change 1 (continued): Customize Channel Page Properly

**Path:** YouTube → (top right) → Your channel → Customize channel

### Required items
1. **Banner image** with a subscribe prompt  
   - Example: “Subscribe to be smarter with AI.”
   - Goal: increase subscription conversion.

2. **Good profile picture**

3. **Channel description** includes the same keywords used in channel keywords  
   - Consistency between “channel keywords” and “channel description.”

## Change 2: Focus on the Analytics That Actually Drive Growth

### 2A) Long-Form Videos: Only Track These 3 Metrics
**Path:** YouTube Analytics (video analytics)

Targets:
1. **Click-through rate (CTR):** aim for **~10% or higher**, especially day 1  
   - Claim: videos with ~10% CTR can drive significant views/subs/watch hours.

2. **30-second retention:** aim for **70% still watching at 30 seconds**
   - Acknowledge: you won’t hit it every upload, but try to get close.

3. **Midpoint retention:** aim for **35%+ still watching halfway through**
   - Claim: hitting this suggests YouTube will push the video more.

**Long-form recap:**
- CTR ≥ 10%
- 30s retention ≥ 70%
- Halfway retention ≥ 35%

---

### 2B) Shorts: Retention + View Duration Targets
**Path:** Analytics → Content → Shorts → (select a short) → Analytics

Two key metrics:
1. **“Stayed to watch”**: target **80%+**
2. **Average view duration / average percentage viewed**
   - If video is **31+ seconds**: target **~80% average view duration**
   - If video is **<30 seconds**: target **~100% average view duration**

Claim: if you hit these, YouTube will push your shorts and growth accelerates.

## Change 3: Stop Relying on YouTube’s “Old UI” for Research

### Problem Stated
- Default YouTube search results are personalized.
- You may not be seeing the videos that are *actually* performing best for a search term.

### Proposed Solution: Use a Tool That Overlays Extra Data (Example: VidIQ)
What the tool view provides (as described):
- **Views per hour** shown directly on videos in search results
- A side panel showing:
  - “Top channels” for the search term
  - “Other search opportunities”
  - Average views, highest views, and related stats
- A “refresh” mechanism that reveals which videos are truly getting the most traction

Core claim:
- The tool removes personalization noise and shows what the algorithm is pushing.

---

## Change 4: Optimize Old Videos (Don’t Ignore Your Back Catalog)

### Why it matters
- Old videos can be “gold.”
- Small updates can revive performance:
  - Title tweaks
  - Thumbnail tweaks
  - Description updates
  - Tag updates

### Workflow Using the Same Tool (Example: VidIQ Optimize)
Process described:
- Link your channel.
- Go to an “Optimize” area.
- Filter between long-form and shorts.
- For each video, get guidance on:
  - Title changes
  - Tag changes
  - Description changes
  - A “content score”
  - Video-level advice (even scripting/editing guidance)

Claim:
- Systematically optimizing older videos is a major growth lever and can drive consistent monthly views from non-recent uploads.

---

## Change 5: Add a Subscribe Call-To-Action (CTA) Inside Your Videos

### Main argument
- Asking viewers to subscribe significantly increases subscriber conversion.
- Example claim:
  - Two videos with ~1.1M views
  - One got 10,000+ subscribers
  - The other got ~2,000 subscribers
  - Key difference: one explicitly asked viewers to subscribe

### Framing guidance
- Don’t worry about sounding pushy or salesy.
- The speaker’s view: creators overthink this; viewers don’t interpret it negatively.

---

## Motivational Framing + Offer (Sales Pitch Section)
- “You’re one video away” from:
  - 1,000 subscribers
  - monetization
  - changing your situation
- Encouragement: implement changes instead of procrastinating.

### Call-to-action (coaching offer)
- The speaker offers one-on-one help:
  - Titles
  - Scripting
  - Editing guidance
  - Feedback aimed at faster growth
- Directs viewers to another video that explains ways to work together.
