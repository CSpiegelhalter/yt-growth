# YouTube Shorts Monetization Blueprint (Script Knowledge Source)

## Overview
- Claim: In 2025, YouTube Shorts generate **100B+ views/day** and top creators earn **tens/hundreds of thousands per month**.
- Personal proof: Creator says they’ve earned **thousands per month** since Shorts ad revenue sharing launched in **2023**.
- Promise: This guide explains how to “get a slice” of Shorts revenue and scale to thousands/month.

## Section 1: How Much Does Shorts Pay? (RPM Reality)
### Common claim vs. creator’s claim
- What Google says: **$0.01–$0.06 per 1,000 views** (1–6 cents).
- Creator’s stance: This is misleading unless your audience is mostly in **low ad-spend regions** (e.g., India/Philippines).

### RPM ranges by audience location
- If targeting Tier 1 countries (USA, Canada, UK, Australia):
  - Claimed typical Shorts RPM: **$0.15–$0.25+ per 1,000 views**
  - Claim: RPM is **rising steadily** over time.

### Example earnings
- Example 1: **$700** from **3.5M views** at **$0.21 RPM**
- Example 2: A short earned **$6,000+**, but had lower RPM historically due to India-heavy traffic; creator says last 7 days show RPM rising to **$0.19**

### Key takeaway
- Creator believes Shorts are **more “untapped”** than long-form because many creators underestimate Shorts RPM.

## Section 2: Monetization Paths Beyond Ads (Music Deals)
### Additional revenue mechanism: music deals
- Definition: Companies pay creators a **percentage** of earnings when creators use certain music in Shorts.
- Claimed upside: Can add **$0.10+ RPM** (or more) on top of normal RPM.

### Access claim
- Most music deals require:
  - Being monetized **and/or**
  - A minimum monthly view threshold
- Creator claims some companies will pay you **from your first Short**, even if not monetized.

### Call-to-action (promo)
- Creator offers access to a “deal” they used to earn **$1,400 on one short** without being monetized, via their community link.

## Section 3: YouTube Shorts Monetization Requirements
### Shorts ad revenue eligibility (stated requirements)
- **1,000 subscribers**
- **10M valid public Shorts views in the last 90 days**

### Income math examples (using RPM)
Assumption example: RPM = **$0.20**
- **15M views → $3,000**
If music deal adds +$0.10 RPM (example):
- $3,000 becomes **$4,500** at same view count
Goal example: **$10,000/month**
- Claimed requirement: about **33M views/month**

## Step 1: Pick a Profitable Niche
### Niche selection criteria
A “profitable Shorts niche” should have:
1. **High virality potential**
   - Can attract millions of viewers
   - Channels can consistently hit millions of views
2. **High RPM potential**
   - Content is monetizable because it’s **transformative**
   - Attracts Tier 1 audiences (higher advertiser spend)

### Example niche used: US politics
- Evidence pattern: Channels can get **millions of views**
- Audience: mostly **US-based**, often **older**
- Conclusion: High virality + high RPM = **highly profitable niche**

---

## Step 2: Channel Creation (Avoid “Zero View Jail”)
### Problem: “zero view jail”
- Shorts don’t get pushed, especially on fresh channels.

### Solution option A: Use an aged channel
- Creator claims they buy “aged” channels for **$5** from **agedytaccounts.org**
- Claimed benefit: noticeable increase in views.

### Solution option B: Warm up a new channel (2–3 days)
- Method:
  - Spend 2–3 days scrolling the Shorts feed
  - Goal: signal you’re a real user (not a bot)
- Bonus: train your feed for your niche
  - Engage with niche-relevant content
  - Swipe away from irrelevant content

---

## Step 3: Create Viral-Worthy Shorts (Production Pipeline)
### Core creation components
- Topic ideation
- Script writing
- Voiceover generation
- Editing

### Topic ideation approach
- Use the Shorts feed to identify competitors.
- Study competitors’ most viral Shorts.
- Create similar content with a **unique spin**
  - Don’t reinvent the wheel
  - Don’t completely duplicate
  - Aim for balance

### Two content types
#### 1) Footage-dependent content
- The clip drives the topic; script comes second.
- Example: “viral generic commentary” (commentary over a viral clip)
- Recommendation: spend more time finding clips; write scripts yourself, then use ChatGPT to improve.

#### 2) Script-dependent content
- Script comes first; footage is found/created afterward.
- Examples: animal facts, quiz niche
- Recommendation: topics/scripts can be generated easily with ChatGPT.

### Tools mentioned
- Voiceover: **11 Labs**
- Editing: **CapCut**

## Section 4: Most Important Metrics for Virality (Retention)
### The two “must-maximize” metrics
1. **Viewed vs swiped away** (percentage who stayed to watch)
2. **Average view duration** (retention)

### Benchmarks suggested
- Stayed-to-watch:
  - Aim for **75–80%+**, ideally higher
  - Creator claims they’ve hit **99%** and that led to virality
- Average view duration:
  - If under 30s: best if AVD **meets or exceeds** the Short length (rewatches)
  - If near 60s+: AVD of **45–50s+** can be strong

### What drives strong retention (stated)
- Attention-grabbing hook
- Interesting topic
- Good storytelling
- High-quality production

### Expectation management
- Not every Short will go viral; goal is to maximize how many do.

---

## Step 4: Post (Volume With Quality)
### Posting guidance
- Post more *as long as quality is maintained*.
- Start: **1 Short/day**
- Ramp: **2–3/day** if desired
- Some channels post **5–10/day** successfully (claimed)

### Caution: ramp slowly
- Posting too aggressively too early may increase risk of “zero view jail.”

### Posting time
- Don’t overthink timing.
- Post when your target audience is likely online.

---

## Step 5: Outsource and Scale
### Core scaling idea
- Creator claims they have not edited any Shorts themselves since starting.
- Claimed time requirement: running one channel can take **1–2 hours/month** (because outsourced).

### Why outsource
- If you spend hours/day editing, you’re “greatly disadvantaged.”

### Hiring options mentioned
- Fiverr
- Upwork
- OnlineJobsPH (creator’s preferred; claims affordability)

### Scaling model
- Hire editors to run **multiple channels** efficiently.

---

## Section 5: The “Most Important Advice” (Consistency + Volume)
### The two required success variables
1. **Consistency**
2. **Volume**

### Claim: Without both, success is “physically impossible”
- Posting sporadically (e.g., 10 Shorts over a month) then quitting = failure pattern.
- “Most people lack” consistency and volume; those who have them win.

### Final promise
- Follow the steps + maintain consistency/volume → high likelihood of success (according to creator).
