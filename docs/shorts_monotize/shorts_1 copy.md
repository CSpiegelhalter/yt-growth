- Revenue: **$177.85**

### Example: ~3.5M Views
- Views: **3.5 million**
- Subscribers gained: **~4.1K**
- Revenue: **$388.54**

### Example: ~7.5M Views

## The Shorts Update: “Views Shown” vs “Engaged Views Paid”

### Setup: A Side-by-Side Comparison
The creator compares two Shorts:
- One went viral **before** the update
- One went viral **after** the update

They show that:
- The “after update” short can show **more subscribers** but **less money** (differences may vary).
- The **biggest change** is visible in the **Engagement** area.

### The Key Mechanic
- YouTube only pays for **engaged views**.
- After the update:
  - The platform may show a **higher view count** than the amount of views that are considered **engaged** (paid).

### Why It Matters
- A short can display something like **~14–15M views**, but the engagement/payout view count can be **lower** (example cited: engagement showing **9.6M** after the update).

### “Bad News” Summary (as framed in the script)
- YouTube can show **more total views** while paying for **fewer** (engaged) views.

---

## The Good News: Higher RPM After the Update

### RPM Change
- “Before update” example RPM: **$0.16** (16 cents per 1,000 views)
- “After update” example RPM: **$0.20** (20 cents per 1,000 views)

### Stated Averages
- Before update: **~$0.09–$0.16**
- After update: **~$0.20–$0.25**

### Practical Takeaway (TLDDW)
- You may get paid for **fewer counted (engaged) views**, but:
- You get paid **more per thousand** on the views that qualify.
- The creator’s conclusion: the meaningful money change is **higher pay per view**, while the displayed view count is not always what you’re paid on.

---

## High-View Earnings: 20M+ Range

### Example: ~24.2M Views
- Views: **24.2 million**
- Subscribers gained: **~24.7K**
- Revenue: **$2,853.12** (as spoken; formatting in transcript is inconsistent)

### Example: ~43M Views (Biggest Video)
- Views: **43 million**
- Subscribers gained: **~44.4K**
- Revenue: **$4,779.60** (as spoken; formatting in transcript is inconsistent)

---

## Promise of Deep Analytics (What the Video Claims It Shows)
The creator says they will show for top Shorts:
- Full analytics “screen by screen”
- **Swipe rate**
- **Retention graph**
- Other performance screens

(Those screens aren’t included in the provided text, but the promise is part of the script.)

---

## The “Mega Viral Shorts” Formula (5-Part Story Structure)

### Why This Formula Exists
- The creator reviewed ~20 Shorts, found the most successful ones, and “ripped them apart line by line.”
- They rebuilt new Shorts using the same narrative structure.

### Rule of Clarity
- Aim for **4th-grade reading level**
- Keep lines easy to understand quickly.

---

## Formula Step 1: Setup (Stakes in One Line)
**Definition**
- A one-liner that contains the stakes of the story.

**Example**
- “Nobody was buying this man’s food.”

---

## Formula Step 2: Unexpected Action (Ridiculous Hook)
**Definition**
- Reword an action in a way that sounds surprising or absurd to hook attention.

**Example**
- “So, he took out his iPhone and he glued it to the ground in front of his stand.”

---

## Formula Step 3: Explain the Action + Escalate Tension
**Definition**
- Explain what’s happening while increasing tension and momentum.

**Example (summarized)**
- People try to pick up the iPhone but it won’t budge.
- They attempt it secretly, creating awkwardness/tension.
- The story escalates as the situation develops.

---

## Formula Step 4: The “Wo!” Moment (Climax / Twist / Punchline)
**Definition**
- The moment that makes viewers react emotionally (“Wo!”).
- Can be a climax, twist, or punchline.

**Example**
- People stand back up and are met with food they now have to pay for.

---

## Formula Step 5: Call to Action (Optional)
**Definition**
- A final prompt that invites judgment or engagement.
- The creator says you can “take it or leave it.”

**Example**
- “Ridiculous or genius.”

---

## Worked Example: Applying the Formula to a 20M+ Short

### Step 1: Setup
- “Teenagers kept running over this man’s mailbox.”

### Step 2: Unexpected Action
- “So, he dug a hole 5 foot deep.”

### Step 3: Explanation + Escalation
- He fills it with concrete.
- Inserts a massive steel pole.
- Lets it dry.
- Builds a mailbox around it.
- Paints it to look like wood.

### Step 4: Wo Moment (Climax/Twist)
- Next morning: mailbox still standing.
- Nearby: a **brand new bumper** (implying the car lost).

### Step 5: Call to Action
- “Did he go too far or not far enough?”

## Creator Philosophy: Don’t Treat Any Platform as “Forever”
### Core Idea
- If you approach content creation with a “forever mindset,” you’ll have a bad time.
- The only constant is **change**, and creators must adapt.

### Vine Analogy
- The script references Vine-era thinking: “Are you going to do Vine forever?”
- Point: platforms shift; creators evolve with them.

### Shorts as a Launchpad
- Shorts can be a “jumping off point,” not necessarily the end goal.
- You “figure it out as you go.”

---

## Prediction: Vertical Series Features Are Coming
The creator predicts:
- YouTube will likely introduce better **Shorts series linking** (beyond playlists/related videos).
- Vertical content is growing broadly (mentions “vertical dramas” popularity in China).
- Conclusion: the vertical format is likely to stick; learning it now can pay off later.

## Closing & Outro CTA
- Thanks viewers and VidIQ.
- Points to another video: the story of how they got the job and their first upload on the channel.
