# Shorts Jail: The 3 Jails Keeping Your Views Stuck (Knowledge Source)

## Purpose of this Script
- Core claim: If your Shorts views are stuck, it’s not “shadowbanning” — it’s *Shorts jail*.
- Credibility: speaker claims 300M+ views and results for thousands of creators/businesses.
- Promise: “3 keys” to escape + a free tool to avoid going back.

---

## The Framework: 3 Different “Jails”
Shorts performance is framed as three thresholds:
1. **Swipe Jail**: stuck under ~1,000 views  
2. **Reaction Jail**: above ~1,000 but under ~10,000 views  
3. **Format Jail (“30k jail”)**: progress stalls around ~30,000 views (hardest), then “breakout” to ~100,000+

---

## Jail 1: Swipe Jail (Failing the “3-Second Test”)
### Symptom
- Shorts stop under **~1,000 views**
- Diagnosis: you failed YouTube’s **first few seconds** (hook test)

### Principle
- Viewers swipe instantly unless something makes them *need* to keep watching.

### Hook Types
- **Visual hook**: something visually unusual/curiosity-inducing happens immediately
- **Verbal hook**: spoken line that creates curiosity/tension (“Oh no… oh no…”)
- **Text hook**: caption that amplifies the story (“Roblox devs didn’t plan for this”)

### The “Triple Hook” Strategy
- Best creators “skip all three jails” by stacking:
  1) visual + 2) verbal + 3) text  
- Text should *add* to the story (not just subtitles)

### Example: Plane Clip → Upgraded to Triple Hook
- Original issue: strong visual (plane) but nothing else to stay curious about + too long (77s)
- Fix:
  - Keep visual hook (plane)
  - Add verbal tension
  - Add a story-amplifying caption
  - Shorten runtime

### Key Takeaway
- You **don’t always need all 3 hooks** if one hook is extremely strong.
- Captions are not “subtitles”; captions must *increase curiosity* or *clarify stakes*.

### CTA Embedded in Script
- “If you want results… go to viral.school.”

## Jail 2: Reaction Jail (You Got the Swipe, But Not the Share)
### Symptom
- Shorts land **above ~1,000 but under ~10,000 views**
- Diagnosis: you escaped swipe jail but got stuck because the viewer didn’t feel enough to act/share.

### Core Idea: Perspective
- Shorts viewers are not “your friend.”
- They don’t automatically care about:
  - you
  - your job
  - the game you’re playing
  - (maybe your cat)
- You must *engineer* caring.

### Strategy: Pick the Reaction First (Sean from “My First Million”)
- People share/act when they feel something at the end.
- Examples of “shareable” reactions:
  - **LOL**
  - **WTF**
  - **OMG**
  - **WOW**
  - (plus other strong emotions)

### Scriptwriting Rule
1. Choose the target emotion **before** writing.
2. Write the script.
3. Audit every line:
   - If it doesn’t build toward the reaction, **cut it**.

### “You Don’t Share Information, You Share Reactions”
- Viewers share *feelings*, not facts.
- Even educational content must land a clear reaction (often “Ohhh / I get it”).

### Editing Rule: Cuts Matter
- Every second must serve the reaction payoff.
- Removing dead time is critical (walking back, filler, setup bloat).

### Golden Rule of Shorts (Anti-Filler)
- Never extend a short hoping it improves retention.
- If you catch yourself adding extra fluff:
  - stop
  - don’t waste the viewer’s time

### Competitive Advantage Claim
- A **15-second tutorial** will usually beat a **40-second tutorial** on the same topic.

### Transition
- Even if you nail reaction, you still might not go viral → leads into Jail 3.

## Jail 3: Format Jail (“30k Jail”)
### Symptom
- You didn’t get swiped.
- You made someone care.
- But the algorithm stopped pushing anyway around **~30,000 views**.

### Diagnosis
- It’s often not your *idea* — it’s your **presentation**.
- “Your ideas don’t suck; your presentation might.”

### Principle: Model What Already Works (Tony Robbins)
- Find someone already getting the result.
- Copy the structure (not the exact content).
- “Success leaves clues.”

### Key Concept: Outliers
**Definition (general):**
- A channel that normally gets ~5,000 views, but has a 1,000,000-view video → that’s an outlier.
- A channel that regularly gets millions and gets another million → not an outlier.

**Shorts-specific twist:**
- Don’t copy the *idea* or even the *specific video*.
- Copy the **format** (the presentation pattern).

---

## Format Examples You Can “Put a Twist On”
### Format 1: “I’m Filming Myself as Two Characters” (Meta / Multi-layer POV)
- The comedy comes from:
  - self as two characters
  - then a third person spying
  - then another layer spying, etc.
- The “third-person seeing you film yourself” framing is highlighted as broadly reusable.

### Format 2: “Day 1 of X” Progress Hook
- Example: “This is day one of dancing. One second for every new follower I get.”
- Takeaway: you don’t have to copy the activity — copy the progress-based format.
- Visual hook mention: unusual camera placement (e.g., inside a microwave) to start.

### Format 3: Dual Perspectives / Role Reversal
- Example setup:
  - Person nervous they’re late / being judged
  - Twist: the other person (e.g., barista) is also nervous
- Reusable pattern:
  - two-person scenario
  - contrasting internal monologues
  - lands a “me too / relatable” reaction

### Summary Rule for Format Jail
- Find formats that already work (especially outliers).
- Apply your own spin rather than inventing from scratch.

## “Tools” Mentioned
### Free Tool: “Shorts Lockpick”
- Described as a guide to “breaking out of Shorts jail”
- Framed as “somewhat unethical” with a joking disclaimer:
  - “Use responsibly… if you get in trouble, you didn’t get it from me.”

### Additional Monetization CTA
- Mentions a link to making “a crapload of money with shorts” via “3D animation thing.”
- Teases earnings and points to another video for proof/details.

## Compact Checklist (Operationalizing the Script)
### If Under 1,000 Views
- You’re failing the first seconds.
- Add a strong hook:
  - visual OR verbal OR text
- Consider stacking into triple hook.
- Cut length aggressively.

### If 1,000–10,000 Views
- You got the swipe but not the reaction.
- Pick an emotion first (LOL/WTF/OMG/WOW/etc.).
- Remove any line/second that doesn’t build toward that reaction.
- Edit with tight cuts.

### If ~30,000 Views Plateau
- Stop copying ideas; copy formats.
- Hunt outliers and replicate their presentation pattern.
- Put your own twist on proven formats.
