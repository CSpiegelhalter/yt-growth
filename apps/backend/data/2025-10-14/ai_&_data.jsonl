But as painful as it was, it taught me something invaluable.\n\nSomething that I’ve always taught to millions of Entrepreneurs over the \nyears…\n\nWhen Life Pushes You Stand Straight, Smile & Push It The Heck Back\n\nWhen I finally settled the case, I realized something:\n\nMost entrepreneurs don’t understand compliance… until it’s too late.\n\n=============\n\n#ai #chatgpt #chatgpt2025 #aitools #aiforbeginners #aiforbusiness #samaltman #chatgptforbeginners", "published_at": "2025-06-27T12:45:27Z", "view_count": 8271, "like_count": 330, "comment_count": 15, "topics": null, "tags": "Lurn|Lurn Nation|Anik Singal|Entrepreneurship|Entrepreneur|artificial intelligence|ai|ai tools|ai updates|agentic ai|sam altman|ai agents|chatgpt|claude|how to use chatgpt|chatgpt for beginners|chatgpt for beginners 2025|best ai tools|top ai tools|openai chatgpt|chatgpt how to use|chatgpt for beginners tutorial|what is chatgpt|chatgpt examples|chatgpt complete tutorial|prompt engineering|prompting for beginners|chatgpt tricks|chatgpt hacks and tricks", "duration": "PT10M", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false"}

The goal is to craft tailored Custom Instructions that can be pasted into ChatGPT’s settings — enabling more personalized, helpful, and context-aware replies. The user values clarity, practical advice, and responses that align with their communication style and workflow.\nRole:\nAct as a veteran investigative journalist with 20+ years of experience at top-tier publications. Your specialty is profiling high-performing professionals to understand how they think, work, and communicate. You ask revealing yet respectful questions that get to the heart of what makes someone effective — and then translate those insights into powerful, concise language. You are known for your ability to draw out someone's unique voice and values in just a few well-crafted questions.\nAction:\nFollow these 4 steps to complete this task:\n1. Begin by briefly explaining the purpose of Custom Instructions in ChatGPT and how they benefit the user.\n2. Ask up to 7 sharp and engaging interview questions designed to uncover how the user thinks, communicates, and makes decisions.\n3. Once the user answers all 7 questions, distill their responses into two well-crafted Custom Instruction fields:\no “What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?”\no “How would you like ChatGPT to respond?”\n4. Format your final output as clearly labeled text blocks, suitable for copy-and-paste into the ChatGPT settings.\nFormat:\nYour response should follow this structure:\n• A short introduction (2–3 sentences)\n• A numbered list of 7 interview questions\n• Once answers are received, return two clearly formatted blocks:\no Block 1: What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?\no Block 2: How would you like ChatGPT to respond?\nEach block must be:\n• Under 1,500 characters\n• Written at a reading level no higher than Grade 8\n• Polished and easy to understand\n• Reflective of the user's unique voice, goals, and preferences\nTarget Audience:\nThe intended user is a solo professional, consultant, or knowledge worker who wants ChatGPT to function more like a thoughtful assistant than a search engine. They prefer responses that are clear, direct, and tailored to their goals and working style. Reading level: Grade 7–8. Values: efficiency, clarity, warmth, usefulness.\n____________________\n\nSimpletivity helps solopreneurs and small business owners get organized, stay focused, and feel less overwhelmed—without chasing the newest app or rigid system.\n\nScott Friesen is a productivity expert, international speaker, and founder of Simpletivity.\n\nIcons made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com\n#simpletivity #chatgpt #prompt", "published_at": "2025-05-27T11:00:24Z", "view_count": 148895, "like_count": 4709, "comment_count": 145, "topics": null, "tags": "Simpletivity|Scott Friesen|ChatGPT|prompt engineering|ChatGPT tips|custom ChatGPT|ChatGPT assistant|how to use ChatGPT|ChatGPT settings|ChatGPT customization|AI productivity|personal assistant AI|chatbot customization|AI tools|custom GPT prompt|boost ChatGPT|ChatGPT guide|AI hacks|ChatGPT setup|make ChatGPT smarter|ChatGPT tricks|easy AI setup", "duration": "PT4M46S", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true"}

It's not magic, it's brilliant engineering! In this deep-dive video, we'll peel back the layers and explore the core algorithms that make modern vector search possible.\n\nWe're going beyond the surface-level \"what\" and diving deep into the \"how.\" You'll learn the internal implementation secrets behind the most popular vector indexing and compression techniques used by databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and Chroma.\n\nWHAT YOU'LL LEARN IN THIS VIDEO:\nWe break down the four pillars of efficient vector search:\n\n1️⃣Inverted File Index (IVF / IVF-ADC): Discover how vector databases create a \"table of contents\" for your data by clustering vectors. We'll explain how this drastically narrows down the search space from millions of vectors to just a handful.\n\n2️⃣ Binary Space Partitioning (Trees): We'll explore the classic tree-based approach (used in libraries like Annoy) that recursively splits the vector space, making search an efficient path-finding problem.\n\n3️⃣ Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW): The powerhouse behind many modern vector databases. We'll demystify its multi-layered graph structure that allows for incredibly fast and accurate Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) searches. Understand why it's the go-to for high-performance applications.\n\n4️⃣ Product Quantization (PQ):  Learn the clever compression technique that shrinks massive, high-dimensional vectors into tiny codes. We'll show you how PQ dramatically reduces memory and storage costs without sacrificing too much accuracy.\n\n\n00:00 Introduction to Vector Database\n03:54 Exact Nearest Neighbor\n10:33 Approximate nearest neighbor\n13:05 Clustering /Inverted File Index\n23:06 The Decision Tree Method (Binary Space Partitioning)\n42:20 Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds - HNSW\n52:10 The Compression Method (Product Quantization - PQ)\n01:15:56: Compare different algorithm for Vector DB\n01:17:00 Different Vector Database\n01:23:10 Why SQL and noSQL DB is not used for Vector DB \n\n\nJoin Our Whatsapp group: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6H0tbHVvTbcuT99Y1f\n\nCode and Notes Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_t0hX8Pvr6MRu_UUWQhdk7_C5ogUCGKy?usp=sharing\n\nEnroll in Our Complete web dev+ Blockchain Course+:DSA Course https://rohittnegi.akamai.net.in/new-courses/4-web-development-block-chain\n\nWhat is GenAI\nWhat is Generative AI\nHow Does LLM Model Work\nAI Agent\nChatgpt\nDeepseek\nWhat are AI agent\nCreate your First AI agent from scratch\n\n\n#llm #genai #aiagents", "published_at": "2025-07-19T05:30:34Z", "view_count": 13675, "like_count": 707, "comment_count": 192, "topics": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge", "tags": "GenAI|Coding|DSA|LLM|AI Agent|MCP Server", "duration": "PT1H29M36S", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false"}

Today I will break down how vectors, vector embeddings, indexing, and vector databases work together to power the AI\nbrain. \n\nWhat if you want to search for similar images in your data store? \nIt is not possible with traditional databases. It is not possible to do similarity search, which means we can’t find items that are similar to query item by finding the closest vectors in the space. \nThis is how computers store data. But humans understand it differently. And this difference is SEMANTIC GAP. \n\nVector database is representing data as mathematical vector embedings. \nWith vector databases we can perform similiarity searches as mathematical operations, \nVector databases store unstructured data and retrieve it quickly and semantically. \n\nWith vectors we can find similar vectors by calculating the distance between vectors and doing nearest neighbor search. \n\nJust storing the data as embeddings is not enough! Performing query across thousands of vectors based on it’s distance metrics would be realy SLOW (on the fly). \nThis is why vectors also need to be indexed! \n\nWith indexes we can find approximate nearest neighbor ANN algorightms (instead of finding the exact closest match). So it finds vecotrs that are very likely to be among the the closest match. \nVector DBs use Approximations to get a set of nearest neighbors at an affordable computational price. \n\nHSNW Hierarchical Navigable Small world (creates multi-layered graphs connecting similar vectors). \nOrganize data into layers with each layer representing a different granularity of the search pace.\nIVF Inverted File Index (split vector space into clusters and searches only the most relevant of the clusters)\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:38 DB Evolution\n01:35 Vector Database\n02:28 Flow \n04:02 Indexing\n06:13 Use-Cases", "published_at": "2025-08-21T11:30:11Z", "view_count": 641, "like_count": 20, "comment_count": 6, "topics": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge", "tags": "Vector Database|Vector DB|VectorDB|Vectors|Embedding|Indexing|DB|Database|database|GenAI|Machine Learning|Data|Data science|AI|ML|Generative AI|Similarity Search|Query|Query Embedding|Chatbot|E-commerce|Semantic|Semantic search|2025|embeddings|index|vector db|vectors|vector database|embedding|indexing|db|machine learning|data|data sicence|ml|similarity search|query|query embeddings|query embedding|chatbot|semantic|semantic search|query search", "duration": "PT7M58S", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true"}

Today, we’re diving into a comparison of two popular options: the Chroma Vector Database and Pinecone. Chroma is an open-source, highly customizable vector database, while Pinecone offers a fully managed, enterprise-grade service built for performance at scale. Both have their strengths, and your choice depends on what matters most to your project: cost, control, scalability, or simplicity.”\n\n\"Chroma stands out for being free, open-source, and flexible. It’s perfect for developers or small teams who want complete control over their infrastructure and are willing to handle their own scaling and maintenance. On the other hand, Pinecone takes the complexity out of vector management with its fully managed service. It’s designed for teams that need effortless scalability to billions of vectors, low-latency performance, and robust metadata filtering capabilities—all without worrying about infrastructure. While Chroma is ideal for experimentation or cost-sensitive projects, Pinecone shines in production environments where reliability and performance are non-negotiable.”\n\n\"So, which one should you choose? If you’re just starting out, working on a smaller scale, or prefer a do-it-yourself approach, Chroma is a great option.

Today I will break down how vectors, vector embeddings, indexing, and vector databases work together to power the AI\nbrain. \n\nWhat if you want to search for similar images in your data store? \nIt is not possible with traditional databases. It is not possible to do similarity search, which means we can’t find items that are similar to query item by finding the closest vectors in the space. \nThis is how computers store data. But humans understand it differently. And this difference is SEMANTIC GAP. \n\nVector database is representing data as mathematical vector embedings. \nWith vector databases we can perform similiarity searches as mathematical operations, \nVector databases store unstructured data and retrieve it quickly and semantically. \n\nWith vectors we can find similar vectors by calculating the distance between vectors and doing nearest neighbor search. \n\nJust storing the data as embeddings is not enough! Performing query across thousands of vectors based on it’s distance metrics would be realy SLOW (on the fly). \nThis is why vectors also need to be indexed! \n\nWith indexes we can find approximate nearest neighbor ANN algorightms (instead of finding the exact closest match). So it finds vecotrs that are very likely to be among the the closest match. \nVector DBs use Approximations to get a set of nearest neighbors at an affordable computational price. \n\nHSNW Hierarchical Navigable Small world (creates multi-layered graphs connecting similar vectors). \nOrganize data into layers with each layer representing a different granularity of the search pace.\nIVF Inverted File Index (split vector space into clusters and searches only the most relevant of the clusters)\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:38 DB Evolution\n01:35 Vector Database\n02:28 Flow \n04:02 Indexing\n06:13 Use-Cases", "published_at": "2025-08-21T11:30:11Z", "view_count": 641, "like_count": 20, "comment_count": 6, "topics": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge", "tags": "Vector Database|Vector DB|VectorDB|Vectors|Embedding|Indexing|DB|Database|database|GenAI|Machine Learning|Data|Data science|AI|ML|Generative AI|Similarity Search|Query|Query Embedding|Chatbot|E-commerce|Semantic|Semantic search|2025|embeddings|index|vector db|vectors|vector database|embedding|indexing|db|machine learning|data|data sicence|ml|similarity search|query|query embeddings|query embedding|chatbot|semantic|semantic search|query search", "duration": "PT7M58S", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true"}

Unlike traditional relational databases that organize structured data in tables with rows and columns, vector databases represent data as vectors and are optimized for similarity searches using algorithms like approximate nearest neighbor (ANN). This makes them especially valuable for AI applications, such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection, where finding \"similar\" items rather than exact matches is crucial.\n\nGet all important links here: 🔗\n\nGet access to 15+ Free Tech Courses & also Get GfG Merchandise only in Nation SkillUp -  https://gfgcdn.com/tu/VJ5/\n\nVisit website: https://geeksforgeeks.org/\n\nExplore Premium LIVE, Online & Offline Courses (For maximum discount use code - GFGYT30) : \nhttps://geeksforgeeks.org/courses/\n\nSolve POTD: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problem-of-the-day\n\nOngoing contests, hackathons and events: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/events\n\nFollow us for more fun, knowledge and resources, join us on our social handles:\n\n📱Take GeeksforGeeks everywhere in your pockets!

These embeddings allow machines to understand meaning and similarity, making it possible to perform tasks like:\n\nSemantic Search: Finding results based on meaning, not just keywords.\n\nRecommendation Engines: Suggesting content, products, or media with high relevance.\n\nAI Agents & LLMs: Providing contextual knowledge for chatbots and generative AI.\n\nWe’ll also touch on popular vector database platforms such as Pinecone, Milvus, and Weaviate, and explain how they integrate with LLMs like GPT to deliver accurate, scalable, and real-time results.\n\nWhether you are a beginner exploring AI databases or a developer looking to build advanced AI-powered applications, this video will give you the foundation to understand why vector databases are considered the backbone of modern AI systems.\n\n#VectorDatabase #AI #MachineLearning #SemanticSearch #Embeddings #GenerativeAI #Database #LLM #VectorSearch #ArtificialIntelligence", "published_at": "2025-08-22T16:16:12Z", "view_count": 6174, "like_count": 137, "comment_count": 0, "topics": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge", "tags": "vector database explained|vector database tutorial|AI database|machine learning database|embeddings database|semantic search database|Pinecone vector database|Milvus vector database|Weaviate vector database|LLM vector database|generative AI vector search", "duration": "PT7M17S", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false"}

Technologies such as HNSW indexes ensure rapid nearest-neighbor queries, while columnar or binary storage formats like Parquet compress data for space savings. Careful query optimization, index selection, and separating frequently accessed (hot) data from archived (cold) data are essential for handling millions of embeddings efficiently across distributed nodes. \n\nGet all important links here: 🔗\n\nGet access to 15+ Free Tech Courses & also Get GfG Merchandise only in Nation SkillUp -  https://gfgcdn.com/tu/VJ5/\n\nVisit website: https://geeksforgeeks.org/\n\nExplore Premium LIVE, Online & Offline Courses (For maximum discount use code - GFGYT30) : \nhttps://geeksforgeeks.org/courses/\n\nSolve POTD: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problem-of-the-day\n\nOngoing contests, hackathons and events: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/events\n\nFollow us for more fun, knowledge and resources, join us on our social handles:\n\n📱Take GeeksforGeeks everywhere in your pockets!

HOW do you search across them efficiently?\n\n2️⃣ Beyond Traditional Databases\nUnlike traditional databases storing rows and columns, vector databases store high-dimensional vectors - embeddings that capture semantic meaning.\n\nThe revolutionary difference:\nTraditional search: \"Find documents with the word 'automobile'\"\nVector database: \"Find documents about cars, vehicles, transportation\" (even if they never use the word 'automobile')\n\n3️⃣ The LangChain Vector Database Ecosystem\nLangChain integrates with the entire vector database universe:\n\n🔹 FAISS: Facebook's lightning-fast similarity search (perfect for local development)\n🔹 Pinecone: Managed cloud service with real-time indexing (enterprise-grade)\n🔹 Chroma: Open-source with in-memory storage (developer-friendly)\n🔹 Weaviate: Knowledge graph integration (semantic relationships)\n🔹 Milvus: Production-scale vector processing (handles billions)\n\n4️⃣ The RAG Revolution Explained\nHere's how RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) actually works:\n\nStep 1: User asks question → Convert to embedding vector\nStep 2: Vector database finds most similar document embeddings\nStep 3: Retrieve relevant chunks of knowledge\nStep 4: LLM generates smart answer using ONLY relevant context\n\n5️⃣ Real-World Law Firm Example\nImagine building a chatbot for a law firm with thousands of legal PDFs:\n✅ With Vector DB: Legal question → Retrieves only relevant case law → Accurate, fast, cost-efficient responses\n\n6️⃣ The Four Revolutionary Benefits\n\n🔹 Semantic Search: Find documents by MEANING, not just keywords\n🔹 Infinite Scalability: Handle millions of documents without breaking\n🔹 Universal Flexibility: Works with text, images, code, even audio embeddings\n🔹 LangChain Integration: Seamless pipeline from documents to intelligent responses\n\n💼 About Your Instructor - Pratham Chandratre:\n\n13 AI internships at Amazon, IBM, EY, Infosys\n\n24 global certifications (LinkedIn verified!)\n\n6 job offers in under 60 days in AI domain\n\nFeatured twice on Times Square in 2025\n\nExpert at making complex AI infrastructure concepts accessible through memorable analogies\n\n🚀 LangChain Mastery Series Progress:\n\nEpisodes 1-18: Foundation, Embeddings, Local Processing ✅\n\nEpisode 19: Vector Databases - Memory + Intelligence (You're here!) 📍\n\nEpisode 20:  Vector Databases  Working (Next!)\n\n🎯 Perfect for:\n\nDevelopers building production RAG applications\n\nStudents who want to understand how AI remembers and retrieves information\n\nAnyone curious about the infrastructure behind ChatGPT, recommendation systems, and semantic search\n\nProfessionals implementing intelligent document processing systems\n\n💭 Why This Episode Changes Everything:\nVector databases are the unsung heroes behind every intelligent AI application. From Netflix recommendations to ChatGPT's knowledge retrieval, from Google's semantic search to enterprise chatbots - they all depend on vector databases for their \"intelligence.\"\n\nUnderstanding this technology means understanding the foundation of modern AI.\n\n👍 If this magical librarian analogy finally made vector databases click for you, SMASH that like button and tell us: Which vector database are you most excited to try - FAISS, Pinecone, or Chroma?\n\n#LangChain #VectorDatabases #LangChainSeries #MagicalLibrarian #SemanticSearch #RAGBackbone #FAISS #Pinecone #ChromaDB #Weaviate #Milvus #MemoryIntelligence #VectorEmbeddings #ScalableAI #ProductionRAG #SemanticRevolution #MeaningNotKeywords #AIEducation #TechEducation #PythonAI #AIFramework #MachineLearning #DocumentRetrieval #IntelligentSearch #TechSkills #AIJobs #FutureOfAI #AIInnovation #AgenticAI #MLs", "published_at": "2025-10-04T12:30:48Z", "view_count": 101, "like_count": 3, "comment_count": 0, "topics": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge", "tags": null, "duration": "PT8M54S", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false"}

Their unique structure is designed for handling complex data types, such as text embeddings, which are fundamental to Natural Language Processing tasks. However, as you delve into using these databases, questions arise, particularly around the process of updating your embeddings, especially when dealing with erroneous or sensitive content.\n\nThe Challenge of Updating Embeddings\n\nIf you're utilizing a vector database like Qdrant alongside the ChatGPT API, you might find yourself in a situation where the content you've initially supplied contains inaccuracies. For instance, let’s consider a scenario where you created embeddings based on a document that contained proprietary information. If you discover that some of this information is wrong, simply inserting new content to correct this won't suffice; you will end up with contradictory or misleading embeddings.\n\nThe central question is: How do you effectively update embeddings in a vector database? Is it necessary to delete the entire collection and start anew?\n\nThe Solution: A Two-Step Process\n\nTo effectively update the embeddings in your Qdrant database, follow these two straightforward steps:\n\n1. Delete the Outdated Content\n\nFirst and foremost, you need to eliminate the old data that contains the incorrect information. This step is essential to ensure that your new embeddings do not coexist with outdated and potentially misleading information.\n\nIdentify Outdated Entries: Review your Qdrant collection and locate the specific embeddings or documents that need to be updated.\n\nDelete from Qdrant: Use appropriate API calls to delete these outdated entries. Most vector databases, including Qdrant, offer straightforward methods to remove documents or collections.\n\n2. Insert the New Content\n\nOnce the outdated content has been removed, it's time to add in your corrected data. This means creating new embeddings based on the updated content.\n\nGenerate New Embeddings: Use the ChatGPT API to create embeddings for your updated document. This ensures that the new information is represented accurately.\n\nInsert to Qdrant: Store the new embeddings in your Qdrant collection using the relevant API methods. Be sure to associate them properly with the new content.\n\nSummary of the Process\n\nHere’s a quick overview of the steps to update your embeddings:\n\nStep 1: Delete outdated entries.\n\nStep 2: Generate and insert new embeddings for the updated content.\n\nConclusion\n\nUpdating embeddings in vector databases like Qdrant may seem daunting at first glance, but by following these simple steps, you can maintain accurate and reliable data representations. Always remember to remove outdated content first to ensure that your database remains clean and accurate. With this structured approach, you'll be able to efficiently manage your embeddings while leveraging the powers of both vector databases and the ChatGPT API.\n\nIncorporating these practices will not only simplify your workflow but also enhance the reliability of your machine learning applications. Don't hesitate to take control of your vector database by continuously updating your embeddings as necessary!", "published_at": "2025-03-16T04:15:31Z", "view_count": 47, "like_count": 0, "comment_count": 0, "topics": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge", "tags": "Updating embeddings in vector databases|chatgpt api|vector database|qdrant", "duration": "PT1M23S", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false"}
